# YouTube-Data-Analysis-Project

Project Objectives:- Comprehensive YouTube Data Analysis and Visualization.

In the scope of this project, I conducted an extensive exploration of various facets of YouTube data. Using tools like SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization, I delved into multiple dimensions, including identifying the top YouTube channels by subscribers, video views, and total videos uploaded by each channel. I also analyzed monthly earnings and spotlighted the top channel names based on subscribers and video views over the last 30 days. The combination of SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization allowed me to glean valuable insights and present them through comprehensive dashboards.
